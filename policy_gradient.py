"""
Builds and trains a neural network that uses policy gradients to learn to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

The input to the network is a vector with a number for each space on the board. If the space has one of the networks
pieces then the input vector has the value 1. -1 for the opponents space and 0 for no piece.

The output of the network is a also of the size of the board with each number learning the probability that a move in
that space is the best move.

The network plays successive games randomly alternating between going first and second against an opponent that makes
moves by randomly selecting a free space. The neural network does NOT initially have any way of knowing what is or is not
a valid move, so initially it must learn the rules of the game.

I have trained this version with success at 3x3 tic tac toe until it has a success rate in the region of 75% this maybe
as good as it can do, because 3x3 tic-tac-toe is a theoretical draw, so the random opponent will often get lucky and
force a draw.
